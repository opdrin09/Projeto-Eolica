 Smoothing on certain target nodes (e.g.907) for pair ID 11 may have     
 accuracy issue.  Please verify element normal of connected target

 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 11 and contact element type 11 has been set up.  The       
 companion pair has real constant set ID 12.  Both pairs should have     
 the same behavior.                                                      
 MAPDL will keep the current pair and deactivate its companion pair,     
 resulting in asymmetric contact.

 Contact detection at: nodal point (normal to target surface)
 *WARNING*: Smoothing on certain contact/target nodes (for example 907)  
 may have an accuracy issue.  You may switch contact and target          
 surfaces, or split the current pair into multiple pairs, or use Gauss   
 detection.

 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 20 and contact element type 19 has been set up.  The       
 companion pair has real constant set ID 19.  Both pairs should have     
 the same behavior.                                                      
 MAPDL will deactivate the current pair and keep its companion pair,     
 resulting in asymmetric contact.                                        
 Auto surface constraint is built

 *WARNING*: Smoothing on certain contact/target nodes (for example 5079) 
 may have an accuracy issue.  You may switch contact and target          
 surfaces, or split the current pair into multiple pairs, or use Gauss   
 detection.                                                              
 MPC will be built internally to handle bonded contact.

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver used by the Block Lanczos          
 eigensolver is currently running in the in-core memory mode.  This      
 memory mode uses the most amount of memory in order to avoid using the  
 hard drive as much as possible, which most often results in the         
 fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended if enough physical     
 memory is present to accommodate all of the solver data.

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).
